                <p>Welcome to Christ Life World Outreach Centre, (aka Sword of The Spirit Ministries), a vibrant church of our Lord Jesus Christ dedicated to worship, fellowship, and service to the Lord most high.

                    Our church is more than just a building; it's a welcoming sanctuary where individuals and families come together to strengthen their faith through the Word of God and prayers. We seek God above all things.

                    We believe in the transformative power of God's love and the importance of living out our faith in everyday life. Whether you're seeking spiritual guidance, a place to worship, or simply a community to belong to, we invite you to explore all that our church has to offer.

                    Through inspiring worship services, engaging Bible studies, and opportunities for meaningful service and outreach, we strive to create an environment where people of all ages and backgrounds can grow in their relationship with God and one another.

                    No matter where you are on your spiritual journey, you are welcome here. We invite you to join us as we seek to love God, love others, and make a difference in the world around us. Welcome to our church, where everyone is family.
